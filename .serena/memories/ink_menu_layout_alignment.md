Updated Ink UI to use string-width based helpers (`alignWithinWidth`) so menu options and descriptions align without jitter. FocusableMenu now accepts `align` and centers Start/Exit consistently by padding visible width. Welcome screen sections pre-center their content. Verified via `npm run type-check`. Adjusted directory listing to use MenuItem mapping. Useful when modifying Ink layouts.
