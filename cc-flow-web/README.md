# CC-Flow Web Editor

A comprehensive Next.js 15 web application that provides a visual interface for designing and managing complex workflow configurations. Built as a complement to the existing cc-flow CLI ecosystem.

## Project Overview

The CC-Flow Web Editor leverages ReactFlow for visual editing, shadcn/ui for design consistency, and seamless integration with the command-line interface. Currently running on localhost:3002 with functional drag-and-drop workflow creation, agent palette, properties panel, and API integration.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Functional web editor with core workflow creation capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 9.0.0

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to access the workflow editor.

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev         # Development server with hot reload
npm run build       # Production build
npm run start       # Production server
npm run lint        # ESLint code checking
npm run type-check  # TypeScript type checking
```
