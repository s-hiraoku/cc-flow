# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive system architecture documentation for the cc-flow-web project.

## Directory Contents

### Planned Documentation

#### System Architecture
- **system-overview.md** - High-level system architecture and component relationships
- **data-flow-patterns.md** - Data flow specifications and interaction patterns
- **integration-architecture.md** - Integration patterns with cc-flow CLI ecosystem
- **performance-architecture.md** - Performance considerations and scalability patterns

#### Component Architecture
- **component-hierarchy.md** - React component structure and relationships
- **state-management.md** - State management patterns and data flow
- **ui-system-architecture.md** - shadcn/ui integration and design system patterns

#### Technical Patterns
- **api-architecture.md** - Backend API design patterns and conventions
- **file-system-integration.md** - File system access patterns and security
- **workflow-conversion.md** - ReactFlow to POML conversion architecture

## Current Status

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planned** - Architecture documentation is planned for future implementation.

The comprehensive architecture details are currently documented in:
- **[TECHNICAL_DESIGN_SPEC.md](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN_SPEC.md)** - Contains detailed system architecture
- **[PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md](../PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md)** - High-level architectural overview

## Integration with Main Documentation

This architecture documentation will extract and expand upon the architectural sections from the main specification documents, providing dedicated space for:

1. **Detailed Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams with comprehensive system interactions
2. **Component Specifications**: Individual component architecture patterns
3. **Integration Patterns**: Detailed cc-flow CLI integration specifications
4. **Performance Considerations**: Scalability and optimization architecture

## Future Implementation

When implemented, this directory will provide:
- Standalone architecture reference documents
- Interactive diagrams and specifications
- Integration examples and patterns
- Performance optimization guidelines
