# CC-Flow Web Editor - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

The CC-Flow Web Editor is a comprehensive Next.js 15 web application that provides a visual interface for designing and managing complex workflow configurations. Built as a complement to the existing cc-flow CLI ecosystem, this application leverages ReactFlow for visual editing, shadcn/ui for design consistency, and seamless integration with the command-line interface.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Functional web editor running on localhost:3002 with drag-and-drop workflow creation, agent palette, properties panel, and API integration.

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types in production code
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent formatting
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance, optimized bundle sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements

## Integration with CC-Flow CLI

### Launch Integration
The web editor is launched directly from the cc-flow CLI using:
```bash
cc-flow web [--port 3000] [--no-browser]
```

### Data Compatibility
- **Agent Discovery**: Reads from existing `.claude/agents/` directory structure
- **Workflow Export**: Generates JSON compatible with cc-flow CLI execution
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Workflows created in either interface work seamlessly in the other

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
const config = {
  development: {
    apiBaseURL: 'http://localhost:3002',
    agentsPath: '../.claude/agents',
    workflowsPath: '../workflows'
  },
  production: {
    agentsPath: process.env.AGENTS_PATH || './.claude/agents',
    workflowsPath: process.env.WORKFLOWS_PATH || './workflows'
  }
};
```

## Quality Assurance and Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and file system operations
- **Component Tests**: React component behavior and user interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows (â‰¤3 key scenarios)

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Initial Load Time | < 2 seconds | Core Web Vitals |
| Agent Discovery | < 1 second | API response time |
| Canvas Rendering | < 500ms | ReactFlow initialization |
| Node Addition | < 100ms | User interaction response |

### Security Considerations
- **Local-Only Operation**: No external network dependencies
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Sanitized file system access
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitized user-generated content

## Deployment and Operations
